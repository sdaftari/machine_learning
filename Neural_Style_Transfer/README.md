Neural Style Transfer

In this notebook, I have implemented the Neural Style Transfer algorithm of Gatys et al. (2015) (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576). 
I am training a neural network to generate novel artistic images. 
Neural Style Transfer technique merges two images, namely content image and style image to create a new image. 
This resulting image contains content from first image and style from second image.

Topics Covered:
* Neural Style Transfer
* Tensorflow
