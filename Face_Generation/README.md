Face Generation Using Generative Adversarial Networks

In this notebook, I am training a GAN to generate new images of faces. I have used MNIST and CelebA datasets to generate the faces. To initialize the GAN, I am using the MNIST dataset since the celebA dataset is complex.

Topics Covered:
* Generative Adversarial Networks
* Tensorflow
